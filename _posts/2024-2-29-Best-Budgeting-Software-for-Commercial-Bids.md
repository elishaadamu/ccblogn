When you're bidding (or actualizing) a commercial film shoot, there are a couple of different budget software’s you can use. But it's worth mentioning, almost everyone uses Hot Budget. Regardless, it merits a rundown to see what's out there, how they compare, and what any industry context might be.

Occasionally someone new to the bidding world (whether they be in-house or outer-market) may try to use a format that is a bit **outside the lines**. Something that's _'more intuitive'_ to them. These typically don’t work out well.

And it’s worth keeping in mind— _if you're bid can't actualize correctly, you're not actually bidding correctly_.

**Principally a commercial budgeting** software does the following with ease.

- Work easily w/ the [AICP Bid Format](https://aicp.com/assets/editor/AICP_bidform_2019_FINAL.pdf)­­
    
- PO's
- PC
- Freelance day-rates **->** Payroll
- Top Line Costs with detailed tier and client breakdowns.

To date, there are primarily 2 options for commercial bidding. **Hot Budget or Showbiz.** And although there are others, they are lesser known, and lesser used.

## Hot Budget
### The industry standard

As stated, **Hot Budget** is the industry standard. At this point it's what every other bidding software is modeled after.  It's built [on top](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/quickstarts/excel-quickstart-jquery?tabs=yeomangenerator) of Excel, and is therefore lightweight and efficient. Utilizing JavaScript Hot Budget utilizes Excel's [VBA software](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office)  and macro plugins to make a straightforward budgeting software.
